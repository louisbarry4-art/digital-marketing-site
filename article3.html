  <h1>Affiliate Marketing Made Simple</h1>
  <p>Affiliate marketing is one of the easiest ways to make money online. You don’t need your own product, customer support, or inventory. All you do is recommend products and earn a commission when people buy through your link.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Sign up:</strong> Join affiliate programs like <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Associates</a>, <a href="https://signup.clickbank.com/" target="_blank">ClickBank</a>, or <a href="https://www.digistore24.com/en/home" target="_blank">Digistore24</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Create Content:</strong> Write blogs, make YouTube videos, or share posts on social media with your affiliate links.</li>
    <li><strong>Get Traffic:</strong> Use SEO, Pinterest, or TikTok to bring visitors to your content.</li>
    <li><strong>Earn in USD:</strong> Every sale through your link gives you a commission, usually between 5% and 70% depending on the product.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>✅ The key is consistency. The more content you publish, the more chances you have to earn while you sleep.</p>
